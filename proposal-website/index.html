            <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, ⅓ of American adults are overweight due to the lack of education regarding poor nutrition in the United States. 9% of Americans have encountered or are currently dealing with an eating disorder, this prevalence can be traced to the promotion of diet culture through American media. Both obesity and eating disorders have a detrimental impact on one’s systemic health and can lead to conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this digital age, the influence of social media leads to 60% of consumers blindly purchasing products/downloading apps. Influencers are publicizing products that are marketed as easy weight loss products when there is no scientific evidence to these working. This lack of understanding is leading users to blindly rely on products that are ineffective, further promoting poor health.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a couple of apps and websites that help users track their calories and calculate how much they should be eating every day. However, the calorie calculators lack the user-friendly feature of enabling individuals to create and update personal accounts as their weight progresses, making them a less-than-ideal solution. The calorie trackers also do not usually calculate how many calories users should be eating, but instead it simply just adds up the amount of calories consumed.

            <p>
                One relatively advanced example of an existing solution is this <a href="https://tdeecalculator.net/"> barebones TDEE calculator </a> that comes up with a quick google search.

                For a quick read on TDEE, <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/paccats/Contents/PA/PDF/Physical%20Activity%20and%20Controlling%20Weight.pdf"> here's</a> some documentation on the subject.

            <h2>About Our App</h2>
            <p>
                Our website will be a Total Daily Energy Expenditure (“TDEE”) / biometric data tracker dashboard. Our goal is to help dispel harmful myths and conventional wisdoms around fitness, health, and weight loss, clearing away the chaff and conveying the basics: your body composition is a function of calories in and calories out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The needs of the people using the app will necessarily encompass a wide variety of use cases. On one hand, it can definitely be used by gym enthusiasts interested in taking a scientific approach to bulking, but it can be used equally well by those looking to lose weight or recover from an eating disorder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users will log in to their account, where data is cached and stored for later use. They will then enter their height and weight data, and their expected level of daily activity. They will select a goal; to gain or lose weight, and how fast they would like to do so. They will be presented with their maintenance calorie total (the number of calories they require daily to maintain their current body weight), alongside a general level of activity to strive for and a rough estimate of calories to consume.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s a common practice to market every fitness product – paid courses, supplements, and programs – as the “one true” solution to the unhealthy American lifestyle. Our goal is to provide a stripped-down, non-commercialized resource to monitor your progress for yourself. By knowing your TDEE, and having even a rough conception of the activity level and calorie intake level needed to achieve your goal, users are able to develop their programs free from all the noise.
